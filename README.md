# Detecting_parkinson_disease_with_XGBoost
In this model it detects the presence of Parkinson's disease in one's body
# Parkinson's disease
Parkinsonâ€™s disease is a progressive disorder of the central nervous system affecting movement and inducing tremors and stiffness. It has 5 stages to it and affects more than 1 million individuals every year in India. This is chronic and has no cure yet. It is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting dopamine-producing neurons in the brain.
# Libraries used:
* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* xgboost (XGBClassifier)

This model is using an XGBClassifier.

# STEPS:
1.load the data
2.get the features and labels
3.scale the features
4.then split the dataset
5.build an XGBClassifier
6.finally calculate the accuracy of our model.

#Accuracy of this model : 94.87 %
